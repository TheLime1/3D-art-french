## 3D Art Gallery Tutorial using Three.js

## Installation

You need Node.js installed on your computer.
And VSCode as an Editor.
Download link:

- https://nodejs.org
- https://code.visualstudio.com/Download

After cloning, or downloading the zip file, on GitHub (green button `<> Code`) open your terminal, and run:

```bash
  npm install
```

to install all the dependencies.
"node_modules" folder will appear at the left in the Explorer files in VsCode.

Then run:

```bash
  npx vite
```

to run the local server.
You'll see the URL address and the info help. Like for example:

```bash
  VITE v4.3.1  ready in 1759 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://123.4.5.6:7890/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose  ➜  press h to show help
```
